# AHK2 Macro Recorder

A fork of [Raeleus's AHK Macro Recorder](https://github.com/raeleus/AHK-Macro-Recorder) updated for AutoHotkey v2, with bug fixes and improvements.

## üéØ About

This is an AutoHotkey v2 script that enables you to record keyboard and mouse macros. It's based on the work of [Raeleus](https://github.com/raeleus/AHK-Macro-Recorder), who based his work on FeiYue's original AHK1 macro recorder.

## üôè Acknowledgments

- Original AHK1 Macro Recorder by FeiYue
- [Raeleus's AHK Macro Recorder](https://github.com/raeleus/AHK-Macro-Recorder) for the v2 adaptation
- Special thanks to both creators for their excellent work!

## üîÑ Differences from Raeleus's Version

- Updated for AutoHotkey v2 compatibility
- Added script enable/disable toggle (F4)
- Improved mouse coordinate handling
- Better window title matching
- Fixed several bugs from the original version
- Added more robust error handling
- **Control Philosophy**: While Raeleus's version follows a minimalistic approach with just F1 for recording/playback, this fork adopts a more feature-rich control scheme (F1-F4) to provide better user control and flexibility

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

While this version fixes many bugs from the original, some issues may still exist:
- Complex window interactions might not always record perfectly
- Some special keys might not record as expected
- Mouse drag operations might need manual adjustment in some cases

I am actively maintaining this fork and will continue to fix bugs as they are discovered.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Install [AutoHotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Download the latest release from this repository
3. Run `MacroRecorder.ahk`

## üéÆ Usage

### Hotkeys
- `F1` - Play recorded macro
- `F2` - Start/Stop recording macro
- `F3` - Edit macro in Notepad
- `F4` - Toggle enable/disable script

### Recording Modes
The script supports three mouse coordinate modes (configurable in the recorded macro file):
- `screen` - Absolute screen coordinates
- `window` - Window-relative coordinates
- `relative` - Relative to starting position

### Customization
You can customize the hotkeys by editing the following variables in the script:
```autohotkey
PLAY_KEY   := "F1"   ; Play macro
RECORD_KEY := "F2"   ; Record macro
EDIT_KEY   := "F3"   ; Edit macro in Notepad
TOGGLE_KEY := "F4"   ; Toggle enable/disable script
```

## üìù Recording Tips

1. Start recording with F2
2. Perform your actions
3. Press F2 again to stop recording
4. Press F1 to play the macro
5. Use F3 to edit the macro if needed

The recorded macro will be saved in your temp directory as `~Record1.ahk` by default.
