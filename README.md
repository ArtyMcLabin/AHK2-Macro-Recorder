# AHK2 Macro Recorder

A fork of [Raeleus's AHK Macro Recorder](https://github.com/raeleus/AHK-Macro-Recorder) with bug fixes, and different controls. (multiple F keys, for different functions)

## üéØ About

This is an AutoHotkey v2 script that enables you to record keyboard and mouse macros. It's based on the work of [Raeleus](https://github.com/raeleus/AHK-Macro-Recorder), who based his work on FeiYue's original AHK1 macro recorder.

## üôè Acknowledgments

- Original AHK1 Macro Recorder by FeiYue
- [Raeleus's AHK Macro Recorder](https://github.com/raeleus/AHK-Macro-Recorder) for the v2 adaptation
- Special thanks to both creators for their excellent work!

## üîÑ Differences from Raeleus's Version

- Added script enable/disable toggle (F4)
- Bug Fixes
- Added more robust error handling
- **Control Philosophy**: While Raeleus's version follows a minimalistic approach with just F1 for recording/playback, this fork adopts a more traditional control scheme (F1-F4) to provide better stability and slightly more control.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

While this version fixes some bugs from the original, some issues may still exist:
