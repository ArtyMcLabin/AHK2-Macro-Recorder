# GitWorkflow Usage Rules

This project uses GitWorkflow for all git operations.
For detailed implementation guidelines, refer to the AI Agent Instructions section in GitWorkflow's README.md.

Core Runtime Rules:
1) Git Operations:
   - Use .git_workflow/git_workflow.ps1 for ALL git operations
   - NEVER use raw git commands without explicit human approval
   - Report unsupported operations to human for official implementation

2) Security:
   - Follow all security prompts
   - Never bypass security checks without human approval
